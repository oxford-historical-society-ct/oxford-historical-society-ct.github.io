<p><a name="9440C1"><sup>1</sup></a>Charles Elwell, <I>1935 WPA Headstone Inscriptions - Episcopal Cemetery</I> (St. Peter's Episcopal Cemetery), p. 12. http://www.oxfordpast.com/epcemscan12.html.</p>

" &nbsp;A little further on the left we come to a very old house known as the Washington Benham homestead. It is located on the corner of the Chestnut Tree Hill road and the Woodbury turnpike and was built about the beginning of the 18th century. It is a house that would attract attention from a stranger, being of the gambrel roof style of architecture that was little known a century ago. Mr. &nbsp;Benham lived in this many years. &nbsp;He was married three times. My memory does not serve me in regard to the names of his wives. &nbsp;He had three children, two sons, and one daughter, John, who married Jessie Perry of Oxford and now lives in Beacon Falls, on the farm formerly owned by Stiles Fairchild. &nbsp;Geo. Benham lives in Seymour, and the daughter Hattie married Wm. O. Davis and lives in Seymour. Mr. Benham moved to Beacon Falls.<br> &nbsp;The place then passed into the hands of Orrin Tucker and soon he commenced to make the famous Oxford doughnuts and established a very profitable business in this line and the sale of the Tucker Doughnuts extended from Danbury to New Haven. He carried on this business for many years until from old age and infirmities he retired and moved to Milford where he died several years ago.<br>(NOTE: &nbsp;The Washington Benham Homestead is house #81 in the EARLY HOUSES OF OXFORD, CONNECTICUT book, published 1976, Historic House Committee of &nbsp;Oxford's Bicentennial Commission)." http://www.our-oxford.info/davis-reminiscences/Davis-09.html.</p>

"<br> &nbsp;Leaving the main road and following an unused road a short distance east we come to the ruins of what was once the home of Cosmo F. Alling. &nbsp;Mr. Alling was born in Westville in 1841, the son of Lyman and Mary Hotchkiss Alling. He married twice, his first wife was Mary Francis Jones of Westville. A very lovely girl. But her married life was of short duration. She died of consumption a year after they were married.<br> &nbsp;Soon after her death in 1872, he came to Oxford and purchased of the Enos Candee heirs the house which is now the Episcopal parsonage and the farm on the hill, consisting of about 65 acres of land with two barns. At the death of his father, Lyman Alling, he came into possession of nearly $20,000. He then commenced the erection of a fine residence on the hill, and when completed it was one of the finest structures in the town. &nbsp;He spent his newly acquired wealth with a lavish hand. He would give wine suppers at the Oxford House and I have known him to spend a hundred dollars in one night. He was considered an up-to-date sport and a good fellow. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;When at the zenith of his popularity he married for his second wife Miss Sarah Taxter of Westville and they began housekeeping in the new residence with prospects for a happy future. But the young wife did not take kindly to the dull monotony of her rural home and in less than one year of domestic infelicity she conceived a plan to get her husband out of the way. She had his life insured for a good sum and secured the insurance papers on the house and waited for an opportunity to develop her plans.<br> &nbsp;It came soon. &nbsp;One dark and stormy night he came home very much under the influence of whiskey. She took advantage of his weakness and locked him in a closest, then set fire to the house and made her escape down the road toward Oxford. &nbsp;Her husband in the meantime began to realize the situation and hearing the roaring of the flames and he a prisoner, by a superhuman effort, broke down the door and escaped just in time to be saved from being cremated.<br> &nbsp;The house was consumed with all its contents. &nbsp;After this he began a round of dissipation never witnessed in this town before or since. He soon squandered his little fortune and became an outcast, doing now and then a few day's work in order to sustain life.<br> &nbsp;After a while he became a recluse and occupied an old unoccupied house on Governor's Hill, on the Quaker Farms road and, being missed from his accustomed haunts for several days, an investigation was made with the result that he was found dead with the top of his head blown off by a shot gun. Thus ended the career of a once bright and prosperous young man." <br><http://www.our-oxford.info/davis-reminiscences/Davis-12.html>.</p>

" &nbsp;Just above the last named place we branch off from the main road and follow the mountain or short cut road that was used by the early settlers to travel to Naugatuck, thereby saving about one and a quarter miles each way.<br> &nbsp;A short distance from the main line is located the old home of Ebenezer Seeley. He married Harriet Sanford of Oxford and lived all his long and eventful life on the secluded mountain farm. He was a charcoal burner by profession and made a comfortable living selling charcoal and other produce from the farm.<br> &nbsp;They had three children -- Augusta, who married Enos Tyler of Naugatuck; Chary, who married Sir Henry Hine of Naugatuck; and Albert, who married Charlotte Bronson of &nbsp;Middlebury. Albert learned the carpenter trade and worked at that &nbsp;business all his life. He died several years ago. I think his widow is still living at Pinesbridge. Ebenezer Seeley died Jan. 13th, 1878, aged 76 years. &nbsp;His wife died Feb. 8th 1873." http://www.our-oxford.info/davis-reminiscences/Davis-07.html.</p>
